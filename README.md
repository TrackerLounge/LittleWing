# Little Wing
DIY Wing Chun Dummy

# Introduction
By way of background, I am a hobbiest. I initally learned a Wing Chun dummy form from a book - Traditional Wooden Dummy by Samuel Kwok and Tonny  Massengill - ISBN #: 978-1-933901-46-6. [Book on Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/Samuel-Kwok/dp/1933901764/ref=sr_1_2?dchild=1&keywords=Traditional+Wooden+Dummy+by+Samuel+Kwok&qid=1590950904&sr=8-2)
As part of the learning process I used a second book - Wing Chun Kung Fu The Wooden Dummy by Sifu Shaun Rawcliffe - ISBN 978-1-84797-026-8. [Book on Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/Wing-Chun-Kung-Fu-Wooden/dp/1847970265/ref=sr_1_2?crid=Y2FSG9ETC1RE&dchild=1&keywords=wing+chun+kung+fu+the+wooden+dummy&qid=1590950997&sprefix=wing+chun+kung+fu+the+%2Caps%2C234&sr=8-2)
At times I had to combine pictures and angles from both books to get a sense of hand motion and striking. 

I have no relations to the authors but enjoyed the books. 

I wanted to learn the form. At the time I lived in a small apartment. In order to learn the form I needed a wooden man but where would I put it and how would I build it. At the time of creation, I looked for plans on the internet and did not find something that would work in my situation. Hopefully, the page will give others in a similar sitation, ideas.

# Construction
I eventually built most of this wooden man (which I called Little Wing) and hung it on my front door. At that time the vertical section consisted of a 8 ft tall 2x4 piece of lumber. I used a foundation tie from home depot to create a hook to hang Little Wing from the top of the door and created a second hook to attach to the side of the door at the top of the door and at ground level. Could not find a picture of this from the apartment. The following images (on a smaller door) will have to suffice.

Note: I used metal foundation plates to create the door hooks. These extend the full length of the green carpet. The green carpet was added to protect the door from these metal plates. I estimated the thickness of the door with a 2x4 plus a small phone book. I used a rubber mallet to hammer the end of the plate around the 2x4 and phone book to form the hook. I then wrapped the metal end of the hook in cardboard and tap to protect the door from the metal. I couldn't add much material too the hook because I had to allow for the door to close in order to set the deadbolt to lock things in place.

Each side arm was attached with a door hing. This was not strictly nessasary but made hanging Little Wing on the door a little easier and make it a little more compact when not in use.

This was constructed with minimal tools: a hand saw, power drill, hand chisel, and hammer. I used my kitchen table as a vise, squeezing pieces between the leaves while sawing. As a result, the construction is rather crude.

This worked fine for several years. When I moved to another place, I did have to sand/fill/restain parts of the door where the hanger hooks scratched the door but it was a fairly easy repair.

At my new place I had more space and options. I considered bolting Little Wing to the wall but feared that it would be hard to take down and repair should I break something. I liked the mobility of my apartment setup. Eventually I decided to mount Little Wing on hinges and gate latches. To accomplish this I cut the top and bottom of the 2x4 and added horizontal mounting 2x4s. It isn't perfect but it has worked ok. I have also liked being able to take Little Wing down when company says in this room. 

The arms and leg are created from 1 in. PVC. Each PVC pipe is attached to a small blocks of 2x4 attached to the main 2x4 body. The small blocks of 2x4 are attached using 3 counter-sunk drywall screws. The PVC pipes are attached to the top of the small blocks using a metal U-shaped electrical bracket, which is attached to the block with three screws. One screw passes thru each side of the metal electrical bracket directly into the small 2x4 block. The third screw passes thru the top/center of the U metal bracket, passes thru the PVC pipe and into the small 2x4 block.

A second 2x4 block is placed above the PVC and was cut/chiseled to create a tight fit. This area was then epoxied. Originally I used Liquid Nail Glue for this purpose. The Liquid Nail Glue failed almost immediately. It formed a gooey mess that I had to scrap,chip, peel, pry, and sand off. The epoxy was then added after this failure and has been in place ever since. It hasn't failed yet, after several years of use. Though there is some slight movement. Do not use Liquid Nail glue.

The top arms are roughly shoulder height for me. You may have to adjust based on your height. At the wood, the top two ares are one fist width apart (or the width of the 2x4). At the tips of the arms, they are two fists apart. Sometimes I wish they are a little wider apart. Without clamps, even the slightes shift in the parts while, drilling/screwing resulted in a big change in distance at the tips.  I sometimes wish I could adjust the height of the shoulder arms and stomach arms a bit.

In order to create the leg, I cut a piece of cardboard as a template and guestimated. I wanted the leg to sit just off the floor, so that if I stomped on it, it would only travel a 1/4 in. before hitting the floor and recieving the floors support. I also wanted it off the ground enought to allow me to open the apartment door. Dimentions are provided for the cardboard template used to form the inner edge of the bends.Once I felt like I was happy with the general shape (in cardboard), I heated the PVC pipe over my kitchen stove around the first bend. I then placed it on the floor, and bent it around my cardboard template. The PVC cooled and harded. I then headed the second area over the stove for the second bend. I placed it on the floor again and bend it around my cardboard template and allowed it to cool. I then trimmed off the excess pipe to the desired length. 

Note: you may wish to fill the ends of the pvc pipes (e.g. with cotton balls and epoxy). I have caught a finger in the pvc end several times and broke a finger (at least once). I did sand all edges and holes to avoid snages, cuts, and other injuries when preforming punches or kicks.

Note: Your door may be a different width than mine. Your hinge placement/depth may differ from mine. As such you may need to use different horizontal supports than I did. I used horizontal support 2x4s that were 34 and 7/8 in. long. This was a bit of a guess. I placed the hinge bolts in the door jam first and then made an estimate of how much additional length the hinge eye bolt would take up and then estimated the horizontal length based on the remaining span. YOu need to make sure that both hinge hooks and eye bolts are sunk to the same depth. I had to be careful to account for the ability to open the gate hinge once it was hung.

Some of the Wing Chun form requires grabbing the dummy's neck for leverage. I used a wood rasp and sand paper to create a rounded neck that is more comfortable to grab at speed than the standard 2x4. When Little Wing was hanging on the front door of my apartment, I wanted to be able to use the peep-hole to see who was at the door. I drilled a hole thru Little Wing, to allow me to see thru.

I added farm gate hinges and latches to these horizotal mounting 2x4s. This allows Little Wing to open like a door to allow me to pass thru the door. Alternatively, I can lift Little Wing off of the gate hinges and place in storage/or repair.

The hinges are common gate hinges. A screwed lag bolt is screwed into the door jam, leaving the L shaped hook protruding.

I used fairly heavy duty gate latches with a dead bolt. I knew these would be required to take kicking and jaring forces as I performed the Wing Chun form. In my apartment I had used a green rubberized bathroom rug as padding to protect the door from scratches and dings. I used some of this carpet on the ends of the horizontal 2x4s to protect the doorjam a bit, provide a tighter fit, and prevent rattling.

This required that I drill/chisel deadbolt reciever holes into the door jam and install metal deadbolt plates. 
Even with the carpeting as padding, the door jam still shows signs of scrapping/gouging.

I attached the original body of Little Wing to the horizontal mounting 2x4s using metal brackets. I didn't love this idea but it seemed to allow me to fairly easily remove Little Wing for modification (e.g. add more complex leg or arm assembly) should I ever wish to.

Note: after releasing this I realized I missed a part of section 2 of the form - haven't gone back and remade the video yet.
